A repository imported with the purpose of code showcasing
The original project was in my fhict gitlab account which unfortunately can't be shared publicly (if you are not part of the organisation), so I have mirrored the project here. 

Backend and Frontend folders contain the code of the project I've been working on. 

I have restructured the folder tree so that it is more readable and that's why I can't promise that the projects will run as intended, but the purpose of this repo is for you to take a peak at a piece of code I have written.
